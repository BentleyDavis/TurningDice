The weekend of NDK (9/4/2021) I spent a few hours donating my time to Gamers Giving at NDK! Selling art kindly donated by Michael Surbrook, Chaz Kemp, Aionk Kreations, and Vee Hume to raise funds for this years charity. I was manning the booth when the pic was taken (and since I could obey at that point the unmasking rules I was briefly maskless for this pic.) Wearing my dice.
