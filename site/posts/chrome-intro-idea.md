Chrome "Punk You" TV 
This is Reality TV not with just a punch but a cannon to the head! (and a Punch line of Punk you!) as an intro adventure for CHROME Players, Gm's and observers.  

There is a show about which rumors swirl, wherein there are only two kinds of people: those who escaped to a life of fame and fortune, and the dead.  Here, you can Risk your life to answer the question of "Are you brave enough to face the challenges of the reality TV show: Punk You!?!?!"

In addition to those who get a thrill from watching others die, the show also is watched by people who have interest in the latest in guns, ammo, equipment, and other dangerous toys, giving them a reasonable chance at seeing some of the more interesting bits from developers. These developers are not the big names in the industry (like those named in the Chrome main book). And in return for talking up and demonstrating these products the show is supported by these companies much like the game shows of old (for example The Price is Right). Exchanging money and gear for viewers to get to see the amazing things possible because if they can’t win it, then they certainly can buy it later.

Part of the draw of the show is, of course, the fact that no one who knows the truth as to what is really going on is talking about it.  While some people claim "it's all faked!" Others swear the results "couldn't be faked". Some say "A friend of a friend knows that their friend never came back from filming the show for realz man!!" Are people killed as it appears in the episodes of the show or is it all faked, or is it both?  In this age with technology available for those with the money and skills it is all too easy to make a person, or a body, disappear. 

Though set up to introduce the characters for building a new life in the Charleston Independant Core (CIC) If the characters win they can still end up in the CIC (Pronounced by the terminally hip as "Sick!") trapped temporarily by the whims of political division on both sides of the border. This should only be done with a high degree of Player buy-in though.  This isn’t intended as a ‘gotcha’ against the players themselves but could be a symptom of the general malaise of the world, and a point for characters to feel trapped rather than the players (who should feel more ‘this is where the game is’ and accept that as a buy in at least initially).

When setting up the show participants typically a GM takes 16 individuals to make up to four groups of combatants. This can be adjusted to fit the play group's size. A slew of NPCs are presented for the GM to be used as needed. After breaking the ‘chosen’ characters down into four groups that can be used in a variety of ways, primarily to be spoken to or compete against the players and optionally, a fifth group who could investigate the scenario looking to see if there's any wrongdoing. 

Adding dramatic  tension by having an outside group investigating it should add some concerns to the players, no matter how they are involved in the investigation

There is a binary decision tree here. If the GM expects the players to engage in the show, win or lose the characters should end up in the default play area (The Core) If the GM and players so desire. Since the characters are likely to be declared dead, then in most cases the simple solution is to place the Film areas somewhere else. 

This show could be running underground in various places in the United States or above ground in another free political area like a major African, Middle Eastern, or Indian/Pakistani City,  a minor Chinese socio-political hub, or any Megacorp polity for representing a good choice for high-tech, relatively life and death scenarios being considered acceptable to certain elements that could be in power.

If one can assume the characters lose, their changes made and will be kicked out of the country then as a second best choice to being dead they could be manipulated into going to the home base of the game Chrome, The CIC and the base defined area in the main book.

On the off chance the characters manage to win the competition either through some lucky rolls, seriously masterful handling of tactical situations, good teamwork or some other genius the player characters could still end up in the beginning area by having part of their rolling victory tour take place inside the suggested game area but then the characters get stuck due to political machinations between the United States and the Core.

If the characters are dumped off, they hopefully have the working of Favor Fave as a way to retain the value of their contacts, If not the actual names and identities previously possessed, but with these new contacts they can then begin to explore the presented campaign world.

After the players have made their decision the GM needs to decide if there is a benefit to the game from having the threat of murder laid on top of the potentially dangerous situation the characters are already facing.  If so the GM can start adding on the layer and consider adding in the details and hints as to what is going on.

If not, the GM can still do elements of this but as a rumor, not a real situation allowing the GM to decide which way he wants to play the cards while also keeping the players who bought the module from easily knowing what's going on. They will be able to search for clues but the open structure of the module and the impact the GM's can have to make the decisions should make the whole process more exciting rather than less.

For GM's running a murder mystery: This is the second option the GM can simply narrate the outcomes or randomly determine them if the GM wants to do that much work. While it might be considered unnecessary prep but the whole system is there to be used which can create lore for the world.

The five people who are most likely to profit repeatedly from the deaths of previous contestants (especially once investigators get a look at the contracts) are the agents and the producer of the show. 

Potentially it could be an associate producer or other financial people. It is unlikely though and the companies who are financially supporting the show would not be interested at all in actual deaths although potentially there could be a outlying corporate executive that thinks the show would be made better by having them die and after having them 'die' on camera and then having them killed after the show certainly isn't out of the question for a motive, perhaps after the deception is revealed most likely on accident.

Financially speaking the show is supported by various sports/tech/gun and weapon manufacturing companies (who might have reason to hire investigators in self defense) that cover the costs of production and offering prizes in exchange for inserted advertising as a way for the less popular brands to try and raise their public profile in an 'honest' way plus the advantage of proffering the visuals and analysis of seeing their tools used in combat like situations. As far as is known anybody who has signed the contract as a show participant who is not part of the winning team never resurfaces. The winning team members of course are feted and often use their fame/reputation as well as equipment to leverage deals, better contacts and more famous speaking engagements.

Much like many race car drivers, not only the winner(s) but many of the competing characters may end up shilling hundreds of products in dozens of markets. To represent this the module offers a series of short one time events. Sponsored by anyone that ponies up the cash. Characters participating will often get a financial bonus and even an in kind equipment boost after it airs and the companies have a chance to see if there is any movement on their radar for their supplies.

Special consideration should be given to cowboys, riggers and projectors who often need to have special equipment in order to use their best abilities individually or on a team. so the show plan is to allow them limited access in order to balance these archetypes against other players.  Denying spotlight time is counter productive to the show. Thus Techies, medic, projectors and Cowboys should eventually end up with some decent equipment in their field.

There are multiple jack points which have to be dealt with and exploring access to the devices in that matter. 3 / only 2 have access to certain items so that prevents the characters from getting into a main communication or weapons hub and able them to attack everyone, spy on anyone, so on and so forth.

Basically a consideration in the design is for the characters with special rules to allow them to utilize those abilities, especially cowboys who should have a reasonable capacity to do things in their field. Perhaps additional chances to explore or find things as a way to reward the character choice they make. 

Thus the cowboys could choose to spy on themselves while readying up defensive weapons, try and search for equipment they can pick up later or they can spy on or attack competitors and allies. Keeping in mind if they split their abilities along multiple scenarios they are less efficient at all the abilities.

Concerning the types of people who are recruited, commonly there is at least one group of people who are looking to raise their profile as an actor/spokesman/model. Seen as a way for some of the less connected or talented people who are as yet undiscovered break into bigger and better things, if they survive.

Another kind of people on the show are those who are desperate (of which there are too many) Talented  (still plenty fill that nich to overflowing) and nominated. Almost all are from reach outs by associated people typically telling a good salable tale to an agent.

The third kind of group is those who are in danger of losing their lives without having gained anything worthy of inheritance although this is a common occurrence in the Chrome universe these people have received some sort of dire warning of mortality resulting in a final stab at their 15 minutes of fame before they pass away completely into obscurity.

An interesting final option is those who are rebuilding from a life of crime and need funding for repartitions or paying off any debt, short of life debts. A ticket out perhaps after one too many burned bridges. 

Each NPC group should be flavored around a single theme. Typical examples include characters drawing  upon the iconic characters from a particular decade,  Group themes (like circuses, entertainment acts, tribal or gang designs, etc...). Whoever is making the group should have fun doing something exotic and flavorful. 

For variant characters even in the vein of impersonation there is a wide variety of choices ranging from political satirists (perhaps adding the Corp Role but focused on a more political build) to developing simsense "identity descendants" of famous characters as a series of Retro Roles/Homages/Reboots.

As a part of this it is ok for players to build homages, builds that adopt the flavor while letting both player and GM lean on the tropes.  Sometimes these characters can form groups around themselves as well. 

\-Madame Webb could be a character with not only the Psychic Role and adventure for their story to be told, as well as having many contacts including a powerful city spirit contact as well. 
-A homage to Jessica Fletcher of Murder She Wrote could be built with Assassin (built to take advantage of the theory not the practice) and Detective for the analysis.

Ideas for more unusual groups: Kachina themed groups, sports stars, dramatists, supernatural beings, parody of corporate Icons, and nearly any category on Jeopardy. Perhaps a band is trying to drum up interest in their album and pay the studio for their first album: "Kickback to your Goddess". or the team exhaustedly or drunkenly went off the map before settling on the crazy compromise they ended up with.
