A﻿s promised here are subtables for the various tap ideas.  As per usual read over the subtables for inspiration or choose whatever seems best rather than relying totally upon random rolls.

Door Subtable 1d5


1 Door resisting: Whether from decaying/improper mechanics, excessive moisture causing wood to swell or intentional design this door makes it difficult to pass the aperture it is a part of. It is detectable as such when approached carefully. To smash through the door requires an athletics + Bulk vs 20, beat the roll by 10 to have any chance to surprise the opposition (and makes a huge racket).  Otherwise use Security + Finesse vs 35 to stealthily open the door (it's tough).  

2 Door, falling: Most commonly in this area this is a trap door, either built that way or someone set a door/cover on an older thing as a safety precaution. Now it is ready to give way.  Doors are called Gates when part of a fence line. But most doors in Ormegarten lead into an internal space. 

3 Door, one way: in a high magic world this would act as a liminal space wherein the only way out is through a quest.  Most often though it is simply devious engineering that is difficult to counter something that either splits the party or prevents easy egress typically as part of a maze, though fire escape style doors are a modern utility that behaves the same way, while acting as a reminder that these doors are often (30%) trapped with an alarm. 

4 Door, spring: when a character forces this door the door may give way then rapidly swing back unless held, often hitting any character next to the door (treat as a Bulk +4 attack by the character opening the door) or if it is a door near the top of the stairs that when flung open may knock a character down the stairs it is adjacent to. 

5﻿ Door, Suspicious: this may either be a projection of a door to get a character to face the wrong way or it may be some sort of cunning art or natural image suggesting a way through that ultimately does not function as it first appears. This can be as large as a dead-end canyon to as small as a half door.

Gas trap subtable use 1d10 for random kind discovered.

In Chrome these gasses and effects that damage like these use similar mechanisms to nerve agents with vastly different effects in the short term.  Similarly these effects can randomly occur when there may be all sorts of caches of alchemical compounds that when unpredictably aged and mixed may react in powerful ways. Others may be derived from knowledgeable alchemists. In all cases bioware and other alterations of a similar sort have their in system effects as given. Typically a random agent may be made with a TN of 30, the aimed for chemical has a 40% of being isolated properly with a tn of 35 (to find out which compound is discovered 7+ is the aimed for compound, 1-3= next but lower compound, 4-6 equals the next higher compound, wrap around the chart if needed). And the guaranteed exact compound has a TN of 40.  These compounds act as a mild to strong air obscurement filling an area equal to rating x10x10x10 in feet lasting rating x 1d3 minutes or half that with light winds and shorter or smaller area if exposed to more air movement. 

1 Gas, blinding: This version acts as a powerful ocular irritant (review the implications of cybereyes)  causing enough visual impairment the players must act as if the characters so affected are blind. The character so influenced can make a 2xGrit test vs the chemicals rating x3 as a Tn to see per action. 

2 Gas, corroding: This version acts as or was all along a powerful acid breaking the bonds between most materials as it sprays out in a sphere from its central point. It does 1d5 x rating in damage per 10 seconds the item is exposed to the material.  It does the shock value (as a % using shock value/100) to any object encountered not on a restricted list (which can be different for different compounds but typically includes ceramics and glassware or other high covalent bond materials). 

3 Gas, fear: This activated chemical acts as a low grade hallucinogen to the inhaler, generating hallucinogenic effects typically which requires a 2xCool roll vs a Tn of 20-30 to not take a -10 penalty to showdowns or any other social roll until the effects pass from a rating 2-6+ effect (1d5+1, open ended).  

4 Gas, nausea: This version acts as a neural/mucus irritant system that mildly disorients the creature inhaling the compound leading up to the onset, hitting the critical threshold forces a 2x Grit test or be distracted for 5 seconds per rating level as the character tries to battle against making noise or vomiting and taking a -(1.5x compound rating) to all rolls until the wave of nausea passes. Then the character feels better until 2/3 of the way to the next Grit test.

5 Gas, obscuring: This Chemical acts as a long lasting air obscurement lasting 5x as long as the average duration for gasses.

6 Gas, poison:  This more common than not incident creates a rating 1d5+1 poison of the most rational type and style of compound for the situation. This can range beginning at rating 1 irritation from poison Ivy liquid to lethal gasses. 

7 Gas, sleep: This compound acts upon those exposed like many other toxins. Instead of the standard poison the damage dealt cannot cause trauma and leads to a knocked out situation mechanically identical to losing the roll shock from an attack.

8 Gas, slowing: This version acts as a neural inhibitor that slows down the perception of the passage of time on a biochemical level effectively raising the characters sequence by one per damage frequency period until it reaches a maximum increase equal to the rating of the toxin, this may exceed normal slowest possible sequence step.

9 Dangerous dusts and particulate matter: unlike the gasses given above these are more likely to utilize the carcinogenic categories perhaps within a short period whereas the compound acts like another distressing compound.

10 Minor insect based impacting items: ranging from Clay bombs filled with plague fleas to nests of biting insects easily overlooked by casual observers. 

Pit Subtable (d5)

1 Pit: The classic for defense is the creation or utilization of additional vertical challenges to standard encounters. At a minimum the basic 10x10x10 pit costs time if not risks life and limb if traversed improperly. Of course to make things interesting in any pit result there might be something in the pit from treasure to a monster to keep the newest addition company (10% Chance checked for both or either).

2 Pit, with spikes: In some cases a step is taken to modify the pit and add spikes. These can be either on the bottom of the pit to make it deadlier than standard falling damage or added to the sides pointing downward to make escape much harder. This combination is easier to create than many lids though capturing the victim alive for interrogation is much harder. 

3 Pit with poisoned spikes: when it comes to spiked pits adding a variety of flavors why not include toxic compounds. Typically in a random pit the poison is level 1d5. Other pits will generally have the best possible long lasting poison for defense. Even finding a naturally occurring pit or a cunning engineer having added poison Oak or Ivy to a pit to make it harder to escape by adding a distraction element to the pit isn't a bad idea.

4 Pit, locking and flooding: after one gets locked in a pit time will feel like it is passing even faster with a water element added to the situation. Now characters have to hurry in their escape attempt or drown as some sort of source will fill the pit past the lid making breathing difficult for most. In addition these pits often stay full for hours if not days. Use the rules for escaping a locked pit but use an open ended 1 to 3 of d10  to decide how many minutes the player character has to escape before drowning begins.

5 Pit locking: an additional complication to the basic pit trap this adds on top of the difficulty and embarrassment of falling into the pit itself by having a lid and locking device to prevent ease of egress for those in the pit. These can have a variety of systems to restrict victims from sheer weight to complex hidden release mechanisms. In almost every case these require Security + Fineness at a minimum to represent thinking how to manipulate the system from inside to escape.
