 Oooh! Another "roll of the Day" post to show a set up of my dice and reading them. 

T﻿oday's dice setup is :

1﻿d% (10's only ), 2d20, 2d﻿12, 2d﻿%, d﻿8, 2d﻿6 and 2d4

They give us:

60 (d% read as 10's)

 10, 7 (2d20)

 11, 10, (2d12)

72, 59 ﻿(2d%) 

6﻿

6, 6  (on the d6's) 

and 3 & 2 on the  (2d4)
