M﻿y work had a wreath building competition for the final week of the year. I'm the kind of guy who is not going to let an opportunity pass for me to do some dice themed shenanigans 

 So I decided to showcase a set of my dice based upon an experimental casting of mardi gras Beads. 

T﻿he beads were originally a purple, the resin chemicals bleached the dice to a hot pink. I then took and added yellow paint to the pips after a base coat of matching pink to keep the inside colors the same. 

I﻿'ll sell you the dice, chain and ornament as a set for 30$
