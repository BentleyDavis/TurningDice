These are set up as online playable versions for seeing some of the basics as to how Chrome works.  Good if I ever get off my duff and actually bring some Chrome to the masses.  And work well as prebuilt character sheets for play at a TTRPG Convention.

All I really ask is to respect the contents for other people and don't be a problem.  Use them, make copies if you want (they probably aren't completely done yet either) they are just Google sheets for the "Punk You!" module initially and as practice for building characters out.  Letting me test the system some.
