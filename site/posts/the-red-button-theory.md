summary: There are some issues with clocks

I﻿ ran across a discussion about Clocks that the redditor indicated that there were two key elements to Clocks in TTRPG's 

1﻿. The end point has to be known (when the clock strikes per say).

2﻿. the repercussions/results have to be announced when the clock is started. 

I'm not sure I agree with those statements. but let's pretend like they are right for the moment.  Some people bounce off clocks as well and I think there is some elements that stretch back to the 70's and aren't brought forward with this interpretation of Clocks.

Of course, back in the 70's there wasn't a so named clock system although there were several elements that can easily be pointed to as fulfilling all those elements (even the ones I disagree with) the escape from the Volcano mechanics at the end of the A4 Module In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords by Lawrence Schick as an example of a clock that stops for nothing (with telegraphed foreknowledge that this is going to lead to a volcanic interruption and a "rocks fall everybody dies" situation) and instructions for the Gm to keep an eye on the clock and every 15 minutes announce another volcanic rumble until the players get on the boat and off the island (specifically: no rests to recover spells or anything else.)

Which means that Clocks aren't new, they are newly named.  just not new.

What does this have to do with red buttons?

Simply put there are two kinds of Red buttons: ones which have a klaxon, a countdown and announce the equivalent to "Self-Destruct sequence is in X Time" and then starts counting down (the "Clock" as described above).  maybe not as dramatic as spelled out but still essentially the same.

﻿And then there is a Red button that when pushed... doesn't communicate anything.  Now then to some people this is nothing.  But this Red button that doesn't say what it does, is to other people the equivalent of not seeing the monster in the horror movie.  To other people this is a pretty stressful mechanic because now they have to investigate to figure out which one of these four (or more!) events actually happened.

1. It might be a red herring/dud (a time waster as well)
2. It might be a silent alarm (there is a temporary increase in issues)
3. Payoff of an element previously seen (like releasing a monster, that unlike the silent alarm permanently changes the environment by adding a layer that previously wasn't involved or cordoned off from the play area.
4. It might have changed something that could open a treasure/reward of some sort. (reward for triggering the event)
5. A﻿ self-destruct or other sequence just like a Clock.  (See those rules, excepting it doesn't inform the limit or the count to the event, unless added later or noted in a different location, like it turns on a monitor or alarm that doesn't reach here.)

This second use also encourages reuse of the dungeon particularly places that have been explored previously.  So \_not knowing\_ what the button does in the dungeon adds to the value from previous prep gains a not insignificant reuse of the areas even if already explored.   

In the end though which one to use really involves knowing the players at the table.   Sometimes a known countdown doesn't raise the stress for a player sometimes it does (sometimes it increases focus, without stress).  Sometimes the button needs to be set up and then which one of the potentials is determined from there.
