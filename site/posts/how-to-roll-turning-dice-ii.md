* Put the dice on a string (note: when rolled this way the dice should be facing upside down to the person rolling the dice)
* Use the string to drag the dice across a surface until they roll.
* lift them up and show them to the camera so others may read them. (block the rollers eyes with the dice so the camera focuses on the dice not the roller).
