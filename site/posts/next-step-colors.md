I really fell in love with the UVO Violet.

At first I made the mistake of really ignoring this sets version of  purple because I like purple but it is often bleah.  Man was I ever wrong. 

This stuff gives Amazing colors and I added in a little secret ingredient that I wont talk about until I get the dice done because I like playing with mysterious stuff. 

Next time we will be seeing what we pull from the mold.
