F﻿or quite a while I have only sold my dice in person.  that changed a few weeks ago and now i offer my dice through a partnership with the owner/operator of a small shop in the hospital I work in. 

R﻿ight now they are availible from 9-5 most days of the week at the Mountain Ridge hospital at 9191 Grant Street.

J﻿ust go to the main entrance, had towards the huge brushed steel HCA sign, and take a right. A little selection is available in the Comfort Corner Gifts and Treasures gift shop right across from Little Miss Latte'.
