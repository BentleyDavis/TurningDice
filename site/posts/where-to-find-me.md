And since we are far closer to the end of a year than the middle, I am being a bit reflective. here are some places to listen to me being excited about my favorite hobby in the whole wide world.

First up is The Itsamimic Podcast. The interesting note that I have probably contributed a question nearly every Mailbag episode (specifically excluding the Patreon Episodes) So basically the Open mailbags. I also talked up my friend Mythica on one episode, and on another episode, it was revealed the Original three have each gotten a set of dice from me.   Not my greatest dice ever made, but a solid start. In addition, while I was working a previous job I had well over 500 comments on the podcast over on Podbean. and I haven't really stopped.  

Next up is I was posting a few things on Mastodon and I was discovered on Dicecamp by theRedcap themself!!! He wanted and interview and I did my level best despite being under the weather with Covid.

The most recent interview came about almost completely by accident.  The Podcast This Ol Dungeon had an open call for people who had experience with Mechwarrior.  And back in the 90's I was in a multiyear campaign that also spun off a Larp so that story needed to be told as well as mentioning my Dice, and Chrome and Meroch which one day will be more supported than currently.
