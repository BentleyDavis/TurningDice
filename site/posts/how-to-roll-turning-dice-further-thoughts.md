Iï»¿ am thinking about putting in more tiny 'improvements'  for these descriptors wherein it would include all the little tips.  might even mark up a photo so any person reading the post wouldn't get the idea to limit the dice rolling to very specific things (such as worrying about using a chain instead of a string).

* Put the dice on a string with all the friction reducers facing the same direction which should also have all the numbers oriented correctly (note: when rolled for outside observers the dice should be facing upside down to the person rolling the dice) 
* Use the string to drag the dice across a surface until they roll.
* lift them up and show them to the camera so others may read them. (block the rollers eyes with the dice so the camera focuses on the dice not the roller).
