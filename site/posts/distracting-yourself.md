Step One: You will need 2d6, the chart below, writing materials and a pausable media.  I suggest Turning Dice, A Bookmark Chart, a journal and pen and a Comic Book. 

Step Two: Read the comic (I know that sounds silly, but you should enjoy the story first and also familiarize yourself with the contents).

Step Three: Distract yourself by using the prompts given below to start where the story starts, but create a whole new experience for yourself with the characters in the story. Free Spin the 2d6 on the chain (letting them turn freely) and the two topmost numbers (or if not upright whichever two faces are most towards the person reading the numbers) get added together to inspire the journaling person to determine what/how changes at each plot point if not panel as referenced in the chart below.

Step Four: Write down at least a paragraph about what in the whole panel would be different in the 15 seconds time frame of a single panel. More if the muse takes you.  The result of the 2d6 suggests some changes and it is up to you to write the differences down: What Happened? Who was involved? What are the details? How does the story change or what details/elements are altered? What impacts do these changes have?

2: Uh Oh! A character in the panel did something ‘wrong’ or significantly ‘worse’ than what happened in the original story, increasing their dramatic tension. 

3-4: Difficulty Ensues! Not that someone does something wrong but a random element goes off kilter. 

5: Hunh? The character involved is more confused or concerned than present in the original story. 

6-7: Nothing to write here. The events presented continue apace. They can be written into the story with any changes needed to unify the story but the main event continues as is. Enjoy the story as is. But likely changes are coming. 

8-9: Introduce questions for the focus of the panel(s) to think about (thought bubbles are great here). Are there moral values or actions to consider and possibly reject? Is the character more or less frustrated?

10-11: Interesting… the character did what they did, but it seems easier than in the story. If you can, imply or tell if this is a further plot point or why it is easier.

12: Amazing! Critical success, something really beneficial occurred for the character. What impact does that have on the character and or the story?
