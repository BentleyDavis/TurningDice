summary: Social Parity?

The first rule of designing a random table is never gamble with what you aren't willing to lose.  	

For me and the kinds of NPC's I like to run I don't like easily losing the goodwill between a PC and NPC if there is any and if possible, taking a chance on building some good will, which can be traded for adventure hooks later on. 

From that design element there should be Reactions from people who view both sides as having a social parity (civil) reaction. It should be able to sour and get better or go in an unexpected direction to everyone at the table (meaning the DM and the players can explore this reaction with the NPC adding a social exploration element to the table for a known character without prebuilding this area, typically done by the DM as an exercise moreso than a real use). 



With that thought in mind here is a suitable starter reaction chart for people who aren't expecting difficulties.  Use 1d10+1, add +1 for positive modifiers and -1 for negative modifiers. (which is why I made it look like a d12 system).	These are all suggestions that will need much refining later on.



Chart A (Polite Society Reaction Roll)


1: A Roll this low indicates the Characters have done something to anger/irritate the encountered creature. Roll on chart B with a d10 to determine the reaction. 


2: Test the Players resolve with what could be mistaken at first as an intimidation roll. The NPC is expecting to fail but upon the PC's reacting to this test will greet the PC's warmly as if longtime friends. Preventing in the process attacks being used if possible, with the successful intimidation but keeping player agency as to the reaction. 


3: Offer to get players through a safe path to a rich treasure but unintentionally lead them into an ambush/trap/great danger. At risk of own life potentially, asks for a 10% share of the treasure in return.


4: Mercenary services: (pre pay, operate independent, per fight). (pre pay, operate independent, per fight). offered on a Short term basis, this is 3 gold per Bulk per creature base and TN of 25 to negotiate down.


5: Mercenary services: (pre pay, operate independent, per fight, max of one day). offered on a Short term basis, this is 2 gold per Bulk per creature base and a TN of 21 to negotiate down.


6: Offers a test of one stat vs. another. Loser takes a dagger stab or swears fealty. (assign a random x2 stat roll). Have the player make a contested Detect Lie + Perception vs the opponent rolling Sleight of hand + Finesse. If the opposing character wins they cheat and choose to stab the player if the player wins they spot the cheat.  


7: Smoothly attempts to redirect the characters to interacting with a foe they think the players might succeed against. Or weaken in a struggle for their own benefit, their estimations might be wildly off though.


8: Offers a test of one stat vs. another. Loser takes a dagger stab or swears fealty. (assign a random x2 stat roll). Loser agrees to serve the winner for one day.


9: Mercenary services: (pre pay, operate independent, per fight). offered on a short term basis, this is 1 gold per Bulk per creature base and a TN of 18 to negotiate down.


10: Attempt to invite the PC party to their own territory for a feast to sway players against further intrusions defensively. This can involve creating food displays, demonstrations of power such as traps or trophies, having captured other creatures to throw at enemies or proof of sending a messenger to another tribe to come join them in 1d10 weeks.   


11:  Offer a lesser creature as a vassal to the players for a year and a day. Refusal must be handled properly or else it will result in difficulties.


12: The Character will consider forming a long term potentially positive bond.
