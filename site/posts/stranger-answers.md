M﻿y Wonderful wife is rewatching Stranger Things.  She often rewatches things that have caught her eye.  I am no stranger to Buffy, and many other classic TV media due to my wife (I would probably prefer to live under a rock and write but alas, we are who we are). 

 ﻿

T﻿he real point is I was mulling over the complaints that in Stranger Things despite having the books on the table the writers have no clue how the game is played.  I'm fairly decent in 1EAD&D lore/play.

While I do follow a few others who also think about such things, think I have a solution. to the d20+Fireball Problem.

It hinges on a few points:  

1﻿. DM empowerment of players.

2﻿. Actual rules in the book.

3. Traditional solutions to missing necessary dice.



Here goes:

1. I﻿f a DM allowed a player to roll all the dice affecting a spell as a way to drive agency (even if it wasn't called that at the time) as a tradition.

2. Magic Resistance ranges from n/a (functionally zero) to 0 to 100% always moving in 5% steps. Depending upon the level of the mage (which would move the needle).

3. In the 70's players didn't always have the 'correct' dice to play a game with (in this case perhaps missing the d% die), resulting in the need to make compromises. 

Thus when facing a 'monster' powerful enough to have Magic Resistance, then the player should roll to see if their spell gets past Magical Resistance. We see with limited dice the correct way to proceed would be to use a d20. 

S﻿o if one is rolling the magical resistance for the monster and they have a 60% magic Resistance you need a 13 or higher on a d20 to beat their magic resistance and see if the spell beast the magic resistance.  Problem solved.
