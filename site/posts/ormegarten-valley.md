T﻿his is a nice sample area for my players to encounter some challenges for the reward of being able to spy upon part of the Ormegarten Valley if they win this area and solve the challenges.  Who knows what secrets they might discover if they can win past this challenge of multiple layers.

AAT. THE TREE FORT: Possibly the only place to have a commanding view of both cavernous complexes this Mighty Oak nearly died in the fire but has since grown again with new life and has been turned into a place of well-hidden but near comfort for a small band of one of four members of the humanoid tribes. This is done in part by having built a series of rungs into the tree. Note that climbing from level to level involves putting ones back to any threat from each room. Thieves may try to negate this through their climbing prowess and spellcasters can of course use many spells to overcome this problem. The tree fort is a uniquely indefensible location because the branches do not provide (obviously) the same protection as the several feet of rock the caves do provide so that is a consideration for this location.		

0. DM Notes: The tree fort is only rarely inhabited. Typically by survivors of defeated tribal groups, especially those considering leaving. Unpopular because of the amount of daylight most nocturnal creatures would face it beats (if only slightly) camping on the ground. Should the player characters rack up killing or kicking out two temporary groups of this 'fort' the third group will set up ‘entertainment’ for the next visitors to the tree house. It could include the following ideas: loose planks (1 pip of damage for barking a shin), bent and tied springy saplings (1 pip for merely a branch or with daggers in them dealing 3 damage if triggered by breaking thin strips of leather) most will have to use Investigation + Perception vs. a Tn of 20 to find these.	
	
1. AAT01. Root of the Problem: this is a shady space of bare earth that may point out the characters there are signs of Scab kins and some sort of snake if they attempt to track, no matter their skill level.  Here is a coil of Viral Verminous Snakes, (see the Monster section) but being comfortable in their hole they typically are too slow to enter into combat with someone directly climbing into the trees within 2 minutes of the first intruder but may interact with those involved in long planning or casting sessions underneath the boughs or who climb down within 3 hours of climbing up.				
	
2. AAT02. Low branches: It appears that the last dwellers here carefully trimmed the branches then tied various limbs to each other to keep the concealment utility of the tree. Several branches have been trimmed back to the trunk that have since rotted away forming holes on the trunk. The floor is a weaving mix of lathes and planks attached to the branches resulting in a wavy but usable floor.	If the players investigate the five or six hollows in the trunk there is what appears to be jade or emeralds hidden in two of the holes in the tree trunk. It seems that the insectoids nesting in these small holes are 2 giant centipedes (See Monster Stats).	
			
3. AAT03. The Mid-layer: Much like the lower level this section of the tree has been modified similar to the previously described area but is smaller than the lower branches area. Climbing up through the floor there is a branch that appears to have grown in the way. Moving it out of the way sets a bowling ball sized and shaped rock in motion that will try to deal 2 pips to the climbing character. It then has a 50% chance of hitting a second character determined randomly for 3 pips damage. If the second character struck fails a 2x Finesse save vs. a Tn of 18 the stone continues to fall to the next floor while it might (30%) come close to hitting another character for 2 pips before half burying itself in the dirt at the based of the tree.				
	
4. AAT04. This is the very top of the tree and by a slight moving of branches it affords what would be a breathtaking view if only the scene was one of beauty and not of the ORMEGARTEN VALLEY despoiled by many ravaging occurrences. Here, scratched into the wood floor is a brilliant topographical and cave map of the area. Anyone (including those working long enough to copy the map instead of making a rubbing) staying till dusk will be disturbed by a thirst of 1d10 winged ticks (see monster stats) who hunt the tree nightly but nest elsewhere.
