This is one of the harder things for me to admit, I am not a master of all trades or even a jack of all trades.  At a certain point I had to admit I could be hurting my dice more than helping when I was polishing the masters. my skills at sanding and finishing are somewhat limited by my family time, my 50 hour work week and the rest leaves me with little time for the many hats a SBO needs to wear as well as being a physical craftsman and artist. 

In turn I went to @sandandshine on Instagram and started emailing her back and forth upon these unusual polyhedrons my brother and I created.  From there we agreed upon some things and now I am waiting upon others.  I hope to see my beauties soon.
