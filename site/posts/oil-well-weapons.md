| <!--StartFragment-->Appearing to be either a Staff, rod or wand built of Blackened iron, lighter than suspected and suspiciously looking like something an artificer would make in part because of a flat six sided button and numbered 0-5 is attached to the side of the tool and a complex double pumping mechanism that actually functions. It detects as magical and operates in combat as if it is a +2 Weapon. The Gm chooses whether it is Transdimensional or translocational. Each Staff is 6 feet long exactly and holds up to 60 flasks worth of oil, A Three foot rod holds up to 40 and a foot long wand holds up to 20 flasks worth of oil.                                                                                                                                                          |
| The flat six sided button is numbered 0-5 is attached to the side of the tool. This appears to be a control button that operates not by being depressed but by being rotated. The lowest setting as indicated on rotating the button to 0 is a locked and closed setting. On the first setting it shoots out in a round a stream of enough oil to count as one flask, the second turn of the button extrudes as much as two flasks of oil. The weapon easily strikes anyone with a stream of oil within 10", for each 5" beyond that the character must make a to-hit roll at +2 but the stream is capable of reaching out to short, medium and long ranges for the weapon (25" is the maximum distance for a long range shot). A miss result creates a randomly determined puddle much like a grenade style miss.  |
| The third setting opens the reservoir to where it can be refilled (but it will still only pour out at most two flasks worth of oil) if left open in combat two flasks will be spilt but each strike has a 50% chance of dumping one of the uses of oil upon an opposed character with a 10% of instead ending upon the Oil Well Wielder. One flask automatically ends up upon the floor forming a puddle which may be ignited as usual or automatically blossoming into flame when it comes in contact with a source of flame.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Oddly enough the weapon functions (0-3) click slightly but noticeably to the operator. Continuing the rotation the fourth setting starts the ‘pumping’ function it does act as a Metronome when the Metronome is activated and may be of use to characters in keeping time as well as for music visually. Then rotating the button towards the fifth setting controls the speed of the metronome like mechanism in order to govern the tempo. <!--EndFragment-->                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
