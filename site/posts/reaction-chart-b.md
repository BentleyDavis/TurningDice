The first rule of designing a random table is never gamble with what you aren't willing to lose.  	

For me and the kinds of NPC's I like to run I don't like easily losing the goodwill between a PC and NPC if there is any and if possible, taking a chance on building some good will, which can be traded for adventure hooks later on. 

From that design element there should be Reactions from people who view both sides as having a social inequality for whatever reason reaction. It should start out fairly negative/ seeking to better themselves at the cost of others from the DM's side and get better or go in an unexpected direction to everyone at the table (meaning the DM and the players can explore this reaction with the NPC adding a social exploration element to the table for a known character without prebuilding this area).  This can be good for those who have rejected society in general, or are struggling with anything from 

With that thought in mind here is a suitable starter reaction chart for people who are or set up as expecting difficulties.  Use 1d10+1, add +1 for positive modifiers and -1 for negative modifiers. (which is why I made it look like a d12 system).	These are all suggestions that will need much refining later on.

Chart B (Angry Society Reaction Roll)


1: Murderous intent, irredeemable no further rolls ever made. If able to will attempt to recruit enemies of the PC's and mobilize against them.


2: Start off with intimidation then go straight into the attack.


3: Offer to get players through a safe path to a rich treasure but intentionally lead them into an ambush/trap/great danger. At risk of own life potentially. Promises little interest in the treasure.


4: Casts Curses and Angry insults at the players (get creative!) then runs away. Avoids home area for 1d10 weeks and leaves dungeon. With supplies if possible, otherwise make do with what they have on hand. 


5: attempt to go to own territory and rebuff players further intrusions defensively. This can involve creating traps, capturing other creatures to throw at enemies or sending a messenger to another tribe to come join them in 1d10 weeks.


6: Promise anything but lie about everything (or go completely silent and ignore everything the players do but do not leave) including Mercenary services: (pre pay, operate independent, per fight). offered on a Short term basis, this is 3 gold per Bulk per creature base and a TN of 20 to negotiate down. But if given even a sleight chance switch sides.


7: Smoothly attempts to redirect the characters to interacting with a foe they think the players won't succeed against.


8: Offers a test of one stat vs. another. Loser takes a dagger stab or swears fealty. (assign a random x2 stat roll). Have the player make a contested Detect Lie + Perception vs the opponent rolling Slieght of hand + Finess. If the Monster wins they cheat and choose to stab the player if the player wins they spot the cheat.


9: Offer their current pocket change for the party to go away and leave them alone, or offer Mercenary services: (pre pay, operate independent, per fight). offered on a Short term basis, this is 3 gold per Bulk per creature base and a TN of 25 to negotiate down.


10: Tries to back out of negotiations while defensively leaving but not attacking first.


11: Make an intimidation roll vs. the players after first coaching it in polite words. Then combat.


12: the Characters have inadvertently managed to please the character some how. Roll on Chart A with a d10+1 to determine how satisfied they are with the results.
