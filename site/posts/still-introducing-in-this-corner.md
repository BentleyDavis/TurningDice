Working further on an introductory module for Chrome, a Cyberpunk future of Low magic and High Tech. The intent is to help introduce the characters and systems for playing through this uncertain future.

This show could be running underground in various places in the United States or above ground in another free political area like a special zone just outside of a major African, Middle Eastern, or Indian/Pakistani City,  a minor Chinese socio-political hub, or any Megacorp polity for representing a good choice for high-tech, relatively accepting of life and death scenarios being considered acceptable to certain elements that could be in power.  

If one can assume the characters 'lose' the competition, changes to the characters can be made and they would be kicked out of the country into the Core, then as a second best choice to being 'dead' they could be manipulated into going to the home base of the game Chrome, The CIC, and the base defined area in the main book.  On the off chance the characters manage to win the competition either through some lucky rolls, seriously masterful handling of tactical situations, good teamwork or some other genius the player characters could still end up in the beginning area by having part of their rolling victory tour take place inside the suggested game area but then the characters get stuck due to political machinations between the United States and the Core.

If the characters are dumped off, they hopefully have the working of Favor Fave (Check him out later on) as a way to retain the value of their contacts, If not the actual names and identities previously possessed, but with these new contacts they can then begin to explore the presented campaign world.  

After the players have made their decision the GM needs to decide if there is a benefit to the game from having the threat of murder laid on top of the potentially dangerous situation the characters are already facing.  If so the GM can start adding on the layer and consider adding in the details, building revelation lists and hints as to what is going on.

If not, the GM can still do elements of this but as a rumor, or a piece of history, not a real situation allowing the GM to decide which way he wants to play the cards while also keeping the players who bought the module from easily knowing what's going on. They will be able to search for clues but the open structure of the module and the impact the GM's can have to make the decisions around the should make the whole process more exciting rather than less.

For GM's running a murder mystery this is the second option: the GM can simply narrate the outcomes or randomly determine them if the GM wants to do that much work. While it might be considered unnecessary prep but the whole system is there to be used which can create lore for the world.

The five people who are most likely to profit repeatedly from the deaths of previous contestants (especially once investigators get a look at the contracts) are the agents and the producer of the show. Potentially it could be an associate producer or other financial people. It is unlikely though and the companies who are financially supporting the show would not be interested at all in actual deaths although potentially there could be an outlying corporate executive that thinks the show would be made better by having them die and after having them 'die' on camera and then having them killed after the show certainly isn't out of the question for a motive, perhaps after the deception is revealed most likely on accident.

Financially speaking the show is supported by various sports/tech/gun and weapon manufacturing companies (who might have reason to hire investigators in self defense) that cover the costs of production and offering prizes in exchange for inserted advertising as a way for the less popular brands to try and raise their public profile in an 'honest' way plus the advantage of proffering the visuals and analysis of seeing their tools used in combat like situations. As far as is known anybody who has signed the contract as a show participant who is not part of the winning team never resurfaces. The winning team members of course are feted and often use their fame/reputation as well as equipment to leverage deals, better contacts and more famous speaking engagements.

Much like many race car drivers, not only the winner(s) but many of the competing characters may end up shilling hundreds of products in dozens of markets. To represent this the module offers a series of short onetime events sponsored by anyone that ponies up the cash. Characters participating will often get a financial bonus and even an in-kind equipment boost after it airs, and the companies have a chance to see if there is any movement on their radar for their supplies. (See the Support Roll Suggestions for more information).

Special consideration should be given to cowboys, riggers and projectors who often need to have special equipment in order to use their best abilities individually or on a team. Given this the show plan is to allow them limited access in order to balance these archetypes against other players.  Arguably denying spotlight time is counterproductive to the show, thus Techies, Medics, Projectors and Cowboys should eventually end up with some decent equipment in their field.  There are multiple jack points that can be accessed which have to be dealt with by exploring access to the devices in that matter. The access is limited to certain items so that prevents the characters from getting into a main communication or weapons hub and able them to attack everyone, spy on anyone, so on and so forth.  Basically, a consideration in the show design is for the characters with special rules to allow them to utilize those abilities, especially cowboys who should have a reasonable capacity to do things in their field.  

Thus, it might be possible a cowboy could choose to spy on themselves while readying up defensive weapons, try and search for equipment they can pick up later or they can go aggressive, spy on or attack competitors and advise allies. Keeping in mind if they split their abilities along multiple scenarios, they are less efficient at all the abilities.  Many other roles have the same sort of advantages. A projectionist hiding and misdirecting until they can strike, etc...

Concerning the types of people who are recruited not just their Roles as defined by Chrome, commonly there is at least one group of people who are looking to raise their profile as an actor/spokesman/model. Seen as a way for some of the less connected or talented people who are as yet undiscovered break into bigger and better things, if they survive.

Another kind of people on the show are those who are desperate (of which there are too many) Talented (still plenty fill that niche to overflowing) and nominated. Almost all are from reach outs by associated people typically telling a good salable tale to an agent.

The third kind of group is those who are in danger of losing their lives without having gained anything worthy of inheritance although this is a common occurrence in the Chrome universe these people have received some sort of dire warning of mortality resulting in a final stab at their 15 minutes of fame before they pass away completely into obscurity.

An interesting final option is those who are rebuilding from a life of crime and need funding for repartitions or paying off any debt, short of life debts. A ticket out perhaps after one too many burned bridges. 

From these basic elements the characters should be grouped interestingly, which will be the next section of the module to bubble up.
