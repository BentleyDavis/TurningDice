A﻿ll of the rooms posted so far about Dungeon23 here mark me as being way far behind.  I'm up to maybe 10? Oops. So I either have to post double days for nearly three months or I should come up with a backup plan.  Fortunately I have at least one.

E﻿mpty rooms!

EL023 This room is an empty Old Kobold style warren (use warren layout #1) there is no monsters or treasure so the players are free to map, explore etc… as long as they want and if they are relatively cautious there is no danger from wandering monsters. However they proceed there does not seem to be much benefit to do so.

EL070 set up as a Kobold style warren use (Warren #1) every movement Action the players take a long a hallway after the initial incline roll 1d6 (1-2= no trap, 3=a painted tarpaulin covering a spiked pit trap dealing 1d6. 4= collapsing wall dealing 1d4 to the player who triggers a concealed slightly dug out floor lever. 5= 1d6+3 spring loaded tubes with foot stabbers In them under small . 6= .) smart searching or testing for traps will find them, they may be sensibly avoided or harmlessly set off and they will not easily be reset. Each room sized space has a guaranteed trap determined by 1d4+2 on the random chart but every 10 ft. Area has one of the same trap.

EL096 Dead Vegetable Garden

EL106 This elevator room is laid out like a stairstep monument but it is lacking even the decorative surface stones as if waiting for information about how it is to be presented as if there is a possibility there could be a variety of monuments these are to be symbolic of. 

EL123 Paused Garden (Winter)

EL133Paused Garden (Summer)

E﻿L170 Paused Garden (Fall)

E﻿L201 This is an empty monastery, going room by room it quickly becomes obvious that the entire place is unused feeling bare walls and the only thing making it not a comfy monastic location is the slight amount of dust and lack of the chosen veneration symbols. 

E﻿L226 The players are faced with walls upon walls of empty bookless lonely 6 foot high shelves. Use the library map but note the area is completely empty but each section may be walked to up the ramps and 

EL241 This is a shattered tavern area (use the standard tavern map) no piece of glass, furniture or cabinet door big enough to be a wand has survived. Searching the entire area over an hour will uncover 1d6 gold and a bottle hidden in the back of a cabinet, a valuable Sherry worth a goodly sum if sold. 

EL253: This is a horribly defaced and smelly garden area that seems to have been torn apart by battle and a spirit of boundless rage. (Use the Garden maze 2)there are many broken pieces of arms and armor and decaying bones along with the smell of urine and death. There might be treasures here the Players are able to find if a careful search is made, a coin or item every round: 1-2 = 1d4 pins, 3-4 = 1 copper piece, 5 = 1 Silver Boar, on a 6 remove one item from the following list as they have found the item: ¼ of a suit of man-sized plate mail (can be found 4 times), ¼ of a suit of dwarf-sized plate mail (can be found 4 times), ½ of a suit of man-sized chain mail (can be found twice), ½ of a suit of elf-sized chain mail (can be found twice, is decidedly -not- the magical and rare elven chain), 2 suits of man-sized leather armor, 2 Shields, 4 daggers, 1 battle axe, 1 mace,(1 flange of which is Silver but appears to be identical to the others until cleaned add 25 Lions in value. Against enemies known to be vulnerable to silver the user may choose to strike with that flange in order to take advantage of their susceptibility.), 3 swords, 2 bows (short, no bowstrings), 1 longbow (no bowstring), 3 crossbows (though they have strings there is a 20% chance they will snap. Check upon the first use each day until the wound wire is replaced), 1d6 arrows (1 in 6 arrows have silver heads) (can be found 4 times), 1d6 bolts (1 in 10 has a silver head) (can be found 4 times), 5 spears (after the first 5 they can find many spear heads), 2 tridents, 4 helmets of various sizes. 50% of these items need a good cleaning before use, preferably scrubbing with a harsh soap, 20% smell strongly of urine and need to be cleaned with some sort of mild acid or base in order to remove the smell (a vinegary wine might work). Wearing/using these urinated items ‘as is’ has a 5% chance per hour of giving a disease to the bearer much to their detriment though the smell will scare anything that is not more powerful than a minotaur. No NPC human or demi human will willingly wear the recovered equipment until it is cleaned and wearing any of these disgusting items in a regulated public or polite society (like a Guild KEEP\Monastery) before cleaning will result in party members being denied entrance.

EL254 Empty Garden area: use a garden map but there isn’t even any soil, and little to be gained unless ripping apart the minimal construction serves a purpose. Use Garden maze 1 for a layout but add a bad smell and descriptions of horrid battle in each separate area.

EL287 This is a unfurnished area laid out to be a pool area. (use the water garden pool map) there is nothing of value unless ripping apart the walls and floors serve a purpose.  Each pool though very much like a room and may be of use for storing vast quantities of liquids, perhaps as a way to transport various water creatures.

EL343 this is a unfurnished but laid out to be a tavern area. (use the tavern map) there is nothing of value unless ripping apart the walls and floors serve a purpose.
