I am posting an image of an odd little container I found on mastodon having found the Global Museum there as well.  This curiosity is listed as being an 18th-19 century cricket cage in the Metropolitan Museum of Arts collection. 

The interesting thing is I have a very small collection of crickets available as treasure, for purchase and a way to diversify the lore for Meroch.   It also helps put the players of the game into thinking about things a little bit differently.  

Here is the current state of the notes about Crickets in Meroch:

Cricket, (fighting or song or lucky), Fighting crickets battle others for their masters sport, while Song crickets is another kind of entertainer and the Lucky Cricket aids in meditation giving a +1 to one person per lucky cricket per day in the same room attempting a Meditation roll. 

And after having found this Item it makes me decide that this makes a good reference photo for finding a little mystery/treasure.   After all, how does one determine if a cricket found in a container of some sort is a Singing, Fighting or Lucky Cricket?  Questions I would have never asked before I saw the picture, and that is part of what makes playing in a TTRPG so interesting. 

Today I am adding in a few notes: that each kind of cricket is worth a base value of **¥2** to 100x value depending upon reputation they can be found in containers that are that range from a value of **¥20** to 10X more value.  In addition, these tiny things are difficult to determine kind without either risking the cricket in an experiment or using magic.
