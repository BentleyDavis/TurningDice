 and I'll email you to get your shipping location and payment method for what dice you want that I have on hand.

1﻿ dice cube 20$

These are the standard set of 7 dice (1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d10, d%, 1d12, 1d20)  These are the Entomological Examples Dice set.  Yes there are bugs in there.  

Side Note 1: if bugs scare you don't look closely!!

Side Note 2:  Demands for them to be set free will be honored, but only after their ransom is paid.  (20$, same price as in town)
