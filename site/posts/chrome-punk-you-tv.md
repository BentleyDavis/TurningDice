This is Reality TV not with just a punch but a cannon to the head! (and a Punch line of Punk you!) as an intro adventure for CHROME Players, Gm's and observers.  These posts are about a concept for a Cyberpunk module in the Chrome game.  This module should let players go from 0 to somewhere north of 50K XP (this is a \_very\_ rough estimate) 

There is a show about which rumors swirl, wherein there are only two kinds of people: those who escaped to a life of fame and fortune, and the dead.  Here, you can Risk your life to answer the question of "Are you brave enough to face the challenges of the reality TV show: Punk You!?!?!"

In addition to those who get a thrill from watching others die, the show also is watched by people who have interest in the latest in guns, ammo, equipment, and other dangerous toys, giving them a reasonable chance at seeing some of the more interesting bits from developers. These developers are not the big names in the industry (like those named in the Chrome main book). And in return for talking up and demonstrating these products the show is supported by these companies much like the game shows of old (for example The Price is Right). Exchanging money and gear for viewers to get to see the amazing things possible because if they can’t win it, then they certainly can buy it later.

Part of the draw of the show is, of course, the fact that no one who knows the truth as to what is really going on is talking about it.  While some people claim "it's all faked!" Others swear the results "couldn't be faked". Some say "A friend of a friend knows that their friend never came back from filming the show for realz man!!" Are people killed as it appears in the episodes of the show or is it all faked, or is it both?  In this age with technology available for those with the money and skills it is all too easy to make a person, or a body, disappear. 

Though set up to introduce the characters for building a new life in the Charleston Independent Core (CIC) If the characters win they can still end up in the CIC (Pronounced by the terminally hip as "Sick!") trapped temporarily by the whims of political division on both sides of the border. This should only be done with a high degree of Player buy-in though.  This isn’t intended as a ‘gotcha’ against the players themselves but could be a symptom of the general malaise of the world, and a point for characters to feel trapped rather than the players (who should feel more ‘this is where the game is’ and accept that as a buy in at least initially).

When setting up the show participants typically a GM takes 16 individuals to make up to four groups of combatants. This can be adjusted to fit the play group's size. A slew of NPCs are presented for the GM to be used as needed. After breaking the ‘chosen’ characters down into four groups that can be used in a variety of ways, primarily to be spoken to or compete against the players and optionally, a fifth group who could investigate the scenario looking to see if there's any wrongdoing.  By adding dramatic tension by having an outside group investigating it should add some concerns to the players, no matter how they are involved in the investigation. 

There is a binary decision tree here. If the GM expects the players to engage in the show, win or lose the characters should end up in the default play area (The Core) If the GM and players so desire. Since the characters are likely to be declared dead, then in most cases the simple solution is to place the Film areas somewhere else.
