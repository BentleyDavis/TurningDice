Another "roll of the Day" post to show a set up of my dice and reading them. 

T﻿oday's dice setup is :

d﻿12

d﻿%

d﻿8

d﻿6

d﻿4

8d10 (for my L5R character)

and finally 2d20

They give us:



5 (d12)

33 (d%)

8

2﻿ (off of the d6)

4﻿

 the 8d10 give us

1﻿0, 2, 7, 4, 6, 5, 4, and a 1 (an ok roll for 8k3 or better) 

finally 15, 11 (2d20) 

A﻿s a bonus for today here is a ton of tags I use on Mastodon to help people find my dice.
