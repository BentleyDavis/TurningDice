"﻿You would think the Assassin with a 2 in Perception would have seen it and ducked!!"

Here we have three character builds for use in Chrome, the first is 9jaboi (ninja) the Second is Mother Allen (assassin, which I found hilarious when I was called that) and the third is Beatrice the 'company man'. 

These are set up as online playable versions for seeing some of the basics as to how Chrome works.  Good if I ever get off my duff and actually bring some Chrome to the masses.  And work well as prebuilt character sheets for play at a TTRPG Convention.

All I ask is to respect the contents for other people and don't be a problem.  Use them, make copies if you want (they probably aren't completely done yet either) they are just Google sheets for the Punk You module.
